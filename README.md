This is the official code for T3M.

I have been busy with my master's thesis for the past two months. I will complete my master's degree on June 30, 2024. Currently, I am traveling and addressing some school matters. I will update the code description on July.

The current code is my own experimental version. I will organize them, but there are some of my improvements to the model in it, which I believe is also of some value.
